I'm an undergrad pursuing Bachelors in Engineering(Hons.) focused in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from
Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani - KK Birla Goa Campus. I'm a Python developer, an AI and ML enthusiast
and love to explore Robotics, IoT and automation. I like learning about personal finance and practising stock trading. I often
find myself cooking whenever I'm not preoccupied with the aforementioned stuff!
